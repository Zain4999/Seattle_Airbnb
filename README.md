# Introduction
A look into what kind of properties a potential investor would invest in if they wanted to list them on Airbnb in Seattle.

# Background
After renting out rooms in my own house I was interested to see what kinds of Airbnb listings would be the most lucrative in Seattle. 

**Question: If I wanted to invest in properties in Seattle to list on Airbnb, what kind kind of properties would I invest in and when would I list them?**

What I wanted to invesitgate was:

- What area is best to invest in
- Which size property is most lucrative
- When the best time to list a property in Seattle is

# Tools I used
The main tool I used during this analysis was Tableau. I used Tableau to create appealing visualisations which communicate the Seattle Airbnb market effectively. I also used Github to share my project. 

# The Dashboard 
I have attached a screenshot of the dashboard below:

# Conclusion

### Insights

From the visualaitions, I found that:

- 98146 is the zipcode with the highest average listing price
- The best time to list a property is March to December as this is when the total listing revenue is high in Seattle.
- It's more lucrative to list a property with more bedrooms.

### Why this can be misleading

This doesn't take into account the following:

- The taxes and varying cost in each zipcode
- The cost to maintain larger properties, which can include mortgage and utility costs

More in depth analysis is needed to determine what kind of properties in Seattle are the most profitable. 

# Closing thoughts

This project really helped me to become more confident in using Tableau to explore and visualise data in a way that is presentable.
