# Introduction
A look into what kind of properties a potential investor would invest in if they wanted to list them on Airbnb in Seattle

# Background
After renting out rooms in my own house I was interested to see what kinds of Airbnb listings would be the most lucrative in Seattle. 

The question: If I wanted to invest in properties in Seattle to list on Airbnb, what kind kind of properties would I invest in and when would I list them?
