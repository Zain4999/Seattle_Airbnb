# Introduction
A look into what kind of properties a potential investor would invest in if they wanted to list them on Airbnb in Seattle.

# Background
After renting out rooms in my own house I was interested to see what kinds of Airbnb listings would be the most lucrative in Seattle. 

**The question: If I wanted to invest in properties in Seattle to list on Airbnb, what kind kind of properties would I invest in and when would I list them?**

What I wanted to invesitgate was:

What area is best to invest in
Which size property is most lucrative
When the best time to list a property in Seattle is

# Tools I used
The main tool I used during this analysis was Tableau. I used Tableau to create appealing visualisations which communicate the Seattle Airbnb market effectively. I also used Github to share my project. 

# The Dashboard 
I have attached a screenshot of the dashboard below:

# The Findings
From the visualaitions, I found that:

Zipcode 98146 is the postcode with the highest average listing price
The best time to list a property is March to December as this is when the total listing revenue is high.
It's more lucrative to list a property with more bedrooms.

### Why this can be misleading

This doesn't take into account the following:

The taxes and varying cost in each zipcode
The cost to maintain larger properties
