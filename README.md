# Introduction
A look into what kind of properties a potential investor would invest in if they wanted to list them on Airbnb in Seattle

# Background
After renting out rooms in my own house I was interested to see what kinds of Airbnb listings would be the most lucrative in Seattle. 

The question: If I wanted to invest in properties in Seattle to list on Airbnb, what kind kind of properties would I invest in and when would I list them?

# Tools I used
The main tool I used during this analysis was Tableau. I used Tableau to create appealing visualisations which communicate the Seattle Airbnb market effectively. I also used Github to share my project. 

# The Dashboard 
I have attached a screenshot of the dashboard below:
